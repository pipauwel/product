# Product Ontologies for the construction industry

This repository consists of three modular ontologies (BEO, FURN and MEP) each containing classes for describing respectively (architectural) building elements, furniture and MEP objects. 
The modules are made using the product taxonomies of the IFC4_ADD2 schema and ameliorated with multilingual labels coming from the bSDD service.

## Version control
The first version of these modules was created within the W3C Linked Building Data Community Group and is stored in the [https://github.com/w3c-lbd-cg/product]() repository.
A new version was created by Pieter Pauwels to extend the original initiative.

Contributing to this repository can happen using regular Git pull requests and branches.
